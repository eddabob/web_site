                    I was inspired to write this composition when our
                     small prep school had been closed down due to 
                     unbearable VATS, and I was only in Year 5. 
                     I thought of all the lost opportunities as a 
                     year 6 for my final year in my treasured school. 
                     So the feeling of loss for me and my friends was 
                     overwhelming and bittersweet. So I wanted to 
                     express this through music- as that was, for me, 
                     the strongest way to do it- and so I wrote 
                     "We are together forever" to express the bond 
                     we had as a class; now, I thought that a short 
                     extract of this piece would be a fitting ringtone 
                     to remind us of our friendship and the good times 
                     we had together.
